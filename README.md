# Padlock-Detection
Padlock detection plays a significant role in security applications. This project focuses on building a model to detect and classify padlocks within images.This repository contains code and resources to create a padlock detection model using YOLOv3 for object detection and InceptionV3 for image classification

We have the **Padlock folder ** that contains the dataset used for this project, divided into two classes [Locked, Unlocked]

**InceptionV3 Notebook:** Classification of Locked and Unlocked Padlocks 

**Yolov3 Notebook:** contains all the steps used to create the model from the start, the model was tested on images, live video and youtube video.
